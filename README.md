Is the [@Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla) ball pit sorted yet? [#AreWeSortedYet](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/arewesortedyet/)

## What is this?
Mozilla is lucky enough to have an enormous ball pit in their Mountain View location, shoutout to Chris Beard.

To make it even more awesome, [@justinpotts](https://github.com/justinpotts) and [@mobyvb](https://github.com/mobyvb) (along with other valuable contributors listed below) are sorting it by color to the tune of ROY G B(i)V.

## How do I get involved?
It's easy. Show up at the ball pit (MTV2 - 211 Battlestar Galactica) and start sorting. We have a little bit of a process that will make things a bit easier though. 

1. Pick a color, any color.
2. Dig down and stir things up. Don't worry about ruining the sorting, it'll get fixed.
3. Remove all the balls that aren't your color and toss them to their respective areas.

Slowly but surely, you'll start to remove all the impurities from your soon-to-be perfect color. When you're ready to go again, pick a color, stir it up, and start sortin'!

A few tips:
- Don't just stand randomly and sort everything. Use your position in the pit to sort everything that's not matching your position's dominant color. That way, you kill two birds with one stone.
- Feel like you're not productive? [@mobyvb](https://github.com/mobyvb) has written [a script](https://github.com/mobyvb/ball-pit-sorting) to help you with just that. Run the Python script, and at a random time within a 30-60 minute interval, an air raid siren will go off. Spring into the ball pit. 5 minutes later, you'll hear "The test is now over." Calmly exit, and resume your normal operations.
- Maybe we'll make t-shirts. Maybe not. But either way, ping Justin or Moby on IRC with your progress! We'll update the dashboard for the whole company to see, and add you to our contributor list.

Happy Sorting!
